# Becoming-an-Engineer
<h1> Becoming an Engineer (Software Developer) </h1>
I just resigned from my job as a business analyst to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer building life improving applications. It wasn't an easy decision giving the current state of the economy and that I have a wedding to plan in the next few months and would literally be starting my own family. A six months 70% pay-cut isn't easy or is it? </br>

# Learning the basics
First was to learn about computer and its components and the simle act of problem solving (not that simple though). Giving that my background is in biology and not computer, i had to learn about both the hardware and software component, the difference application and system software. It was fun knowing how everyday tools are made. Funny, my favorite show is "How it's made"
</br>

I read about the basics of computing, computers, data strutures, and algorithms. Using sololearn and W3 schools, I also learn the fundamentals of programming, basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</br>

Computer programming is an interesting read for me as I learnt it involves writing well structured instructions for a computer to execute - coding. Computer programs are written in a programming language, a computer language that is used by programmers to communicate with computers. Programming langauges are divided into two: Low-level languages and High level langauges. Machine language and Assembly language are two types of low-level languages.

<h2>Bits and Bytes</h2>
Bit is simply binary, mix of 0s and 1s. A group of four bits is called a nibble while a group of 8 bits is called byte. Byte is the basic unit of a computer. A bit is usually denoted by <b>b</b> while byte is denoted by <b>B</b>
