Becoming an Engineer (Software Developer)
I just resigned from my job as a business analyst to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer building life improving applications. It wasn't an easy decision giving the current state of the economy and that I have a wedding to plan in the next few months and would literally be starting my own family. A six months 70% pay-cut isn't easy or is it?
